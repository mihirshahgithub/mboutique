=======
### Step 1
- Open PHPStorm Text
- In PHPStorm Text open your folder that contains the MBoutique project

### Step 2
- Create the HTML and CSS necessary to reproduce the MBoutique home/welcome page
	- Use the index.html file for your HTML
	- Use the style.css file for your CSS
- Use the design images for reference (Found in the assets folder)

#### Screenshot Example

#### Design Doc

#### Suggestions
- Break the page down into sections and build one section at a time. For example:
	- Header section
	- Body/Main content section
	- Footer section
- Keep in mind that there are multiple pages
	- Notice the sections that are the same on all pages like the header and footer
	- Design your HTML so that it will be easy to reuse the header and footer sections on all the pages
- Don't panic
	- If you get stuck or have any issues use google or the LearningFuze forum
- If you are familiar with them, make use of the chrome developer tools to prototype out your changes.
	- You can find more details on [chrome developer tools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) on codeschool and other places. 
- Test each CSS change as you implement it.  It can be difficult to ascertain "what went wrong" if you do many lines of code and then test it.
- Pay attention to the gross details first, and then make a second pass for fine details. 

### Step 3 - Save to gitHub

1. `git add .` - Add all files for staging
2. `git commit -m "MBoutique Home page"` - Commit the files with a message of "MBoutique Home page"
3. `git push origin master` - Push these files to a remote location (origin master)
